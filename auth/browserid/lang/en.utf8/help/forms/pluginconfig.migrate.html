<h3>Auto-migrate Persona users</h3>
<p>Mozilla is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers">
  discontinuing the Persona authentication service</a> as of 30 November 2016.
  If your site is using Persona, you will need to migrate those users to a
  different authentication method as they cannot log in anymore.</p>
<p>This plugin provides a basic option to change all Persona-based user accounts
  on your site to the Mahara "internal" authentication method.</p>
<p>Selecting "Yes" and saving this form will activate the migration script and
  do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All Persona authentication instances on the site will be deleted.</li>
  <li>All users who are on Persona authentication will be switched to the internal
  authentication instance for their institution.</li>
  <li>If their institution has no internal authentication instance, one will be
  created.</li>
  <li>These users will <b>not</b> have a password set. They will need to use the
  "Forgot password" link and their Persona email address to set an initial
  Mahara password.</li>
  <li>The users' usernames will be unchanged.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> Users will not receive any notification that their authentication
  method has changed. You may wish to put a message on your site's logged-out
  homepage to explain to former Persona users that they should use the "Forgot
  password" link and their Persona email address to set a new password and
  access their account.</p>
