Digital Portfolio is an open source web application which gives easy interaction between students and faculty.
It is used to understand the student improvement in their academics as well as their extra- curricular activities. 
It motivates the students to improve themselves in all aspects. 
At the simplest level there are two things: an e-portfolio and a social networking system combined.
An e-Portfolio is a system in which students can post the blogs and pages. These works can be stored digitally.
Such things are known as artifacts. Social networking system is used to communicate with people within their institute.

The main motivation of Digital Portfolio is to make themselves aware of their overall improvement.
